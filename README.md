Educational project to practice React form handling.

## Stack
- [nextjs](https://nextjs.org)
- [chakra](https://chakra-ui.com) chose chakra because seemed to be simpler than Mantine. But from my experience - the community is less supportive, than Mantine's.
- [react-icons/css.gg](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/)
- [react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com)
- [storybook](https://storybook.js.org) (8.0 alpha to play with RSC)
- npm-run-all (to run nextjs and storybook simultaneously)
- [Comparing Schema Validation Libraries: AJV, Joi, Yup, and Zod](https://www.bitovi.com/blog/comparing-schema-validation-libraries-ajv-joi-yup-and-zod)
